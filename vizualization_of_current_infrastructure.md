# Abstract

For a given infrastructure (e.g. AWS account) there is no good tool for immedaitely visualizing what the infrastructure looks like. 

Some problems include:
  - Easily removing ghost or unused resources
  - Integrating different levels or environments (i.e. development vs production, networking and computing etc)
  - Navigating between differnt viewpoints (i.e. business process vs technical flow)
